            <p>Rebecca Knowlton is a Statistics PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Data Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin. After earning her Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics at Trinity University, she worked as an actuarial analyst at USAA for three years while passing the first five exams with the Casualty Actuary Society. During this time, she served as the sole pricing analyst responsible for Texas Auto, the company's largest state at roughly $1.9 billion written premium, and led the auto pricing team for loss trend analysis. She became interested in the other ways in which statistics and data science can be leveraged to solve complex problems, and she decided to return to school to begin a career in statistics research. Her research interests include machine learning, causal inference, and Bayesian statistics.</p>
